# Learning Journal

## Setting Up the Environment

Today, I set up my development environment for the Python Web Development Course. This included installing Python 3.8.19 and Homebrew. I also created a new virtual environment named `alpha` and installed the `requests` and `numpy` packages.

## Creating and Running Python Scripts

I created three Python scripts:

1. `add.py`: A simple script that adds two numbers.
2. `apple.py`: Demonstrates usage of the `requests` and `numpy` packages.
3. `calculator.py`: A basic calculator script with functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

I also learned how to activate and deactivate virtual environments and how to run Python scripts within these environments.

## Documenting and Preparing for Deployment

I created the `README.md` and `LearningJournal.md` files to document my progress and prepare for deploying the project on GitHub. I also ensured that all necessary packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be easily installed in a new virtual environment.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Issue**: Encountered problems with importing `requests` and `numpy` in `apple.py` in VS Code.
  - **Solution**: Fixed the issue by opening a new terminal in VS Code and activating the virtual environment before running `pip install requests numpy`.

## Exercise 1.2: Data Types in Python

### Observations

- Learned how to work with different data types in Python.
- Understood the differences between scalar and non-scalar data types.
- Explored various operations and methods for tuples, lists, strings, and dictionaries.

### Challenges

- Faced issues with understanding the nuances of dictionary operations, but resolved them through practice.
- Had to carefully manage data types to avoid type errors.

### What I've Learned

- Basics of data types and variables in Python.
- Creating and manipulating tuples, lists, strings, and dictionaries.
- Applying data structures to a practical task, such as a recipe app.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Basic Commands and Operations**:
   - Created `basic_commands.py` to demonstrate basic commands and operations in Python.
2. **Variable Assignments and Data Types**:
   - Created `variables_and_types.py` to show variable assignments and data types.
3. **Type Conversions**:
   - Created `type_conversion.py` to demonstrate explicit and implicit type conversions.
4. **Reassignment, Increment, and Decrement Operations**:
   - Created `reassignment_increment_decrement.py` to show reassignment, increment, and decrement operations.
5. **Variable Swapping**:
   - Created `variable_swapping.py` to demonstrate variable swapping.
6. **Arithmetic Operations and Expressions**:
   - Created `expressions_arithmetic.py` to perform arithmetic operations and expressions.

### Practice Tasks

1. **Practice Task 1**:

   - Created `compound_interest.py` to calculate compound interest.
   - Created `codepractice1.txt` to store input values for the compound interest calculation.

2. **Practice Task 2**:

   - Created `tuples_slicing.py` to practice tuples and slicing operations.

3. **Practice Task 3**:

   - Created `lists_operations.py` to perform various list operations.

4. **Practice Task 4**:

   - Created `strings_slicing.py` to practice string slicing operations.

5. **Practice Task 5**:
   - Created `dictionaries_operations.py` to perform dictionary operations.
   - Created `recipe_app.py` to manage recipes using dictionaries.

### Documentation and Deployment

- Documented my progress in the `README.md` and `LearningJournal.md` files.
- Ensured that all necessary packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be easily installed in a new virtual environment.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Issue**: Encountered a "FileNotFoundError" while running the compound interest script.
  - **Solution**: Ensured the `codepractice1.txt` file was created and in the correct directory before running the script.
- **Issue**: Had difficulty with tuples and slicing operations initially.
  - **Solution**: Reviewed Python documentation and examples to better understand these concepts.

## Exercise 1.3: Operators & Functions in Python

### Observations

- Learned how to implement conditional statements in Python to determine program flow.
- Used loops to reduce time and effort in Python programming.
- Wrote functions to organize Python code.

### Challenges

- Faced issues with understanding nested loops, but resolved them through practice.
- Had to carefully manage variable scopes to avoid conflicts.

### What I've Learned

- How to use if-else statements, for loops, and while loops in Python.
- How to define and call functions with and without arguments.
- How to use list comprehensions for concise code.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Creating `name_capitalizer.py`**:
   - Created a script to capitalize the user's first and last name.
2. **Creating `add.py`**:
   - Created a script to add two user-provided numbers.
3. **If-Else Statements**:
   - Created `if_else_operations.py` to perform addition or subtraction based on user input.
4. **For Loops**:
   - Created `top_scores.py` to sort and print the top three test scores.
5. **While Loops**:
   - Created `while_loop_numbers.py` to print numbers from 5 to 10.
6. **Functions**:
   - Created `recipe_app.py` to manage recipes and calculate their difficulty.

### Practice Tasks

1. **Practice Task 1**:
   - Used if-else statements to perform operations based on user input.
2. **Practice Task 2**:
   - Used for loops to sort and print the top three scores.
3. **Practice Task 3**:
   - Used while loops to print numbers in a range.

### Documentation and Deployment

- Documented my progress in the `README.md` and `LearningJournal.md` files.
- Ensured that all necessary packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be easily installed in a new virtual environment.

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Issue**: Faced issues with variable scope in nested functions.
  - **Solution**: Reviewed Python documentation on scopes and implemented global variables as needed.
