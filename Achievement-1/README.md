# Python-Web-Development-Course

This repository contains my projects and exercises from the Python Web Development Course.

## Projects and Exercises

### Achievement-1-Python

- **Exercise-1.1**: Basic Python scripting and virtual environment setup.
  - `add.py`: A simple addition script.
  - `apple.py`: Demonstrates usage of `requests` and `numpy` packages.
  - `calculator.py`: A basic calculator script with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions.

## Virtual Environment Setup

To set up the virtual environment and install required packages, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   mkvirtualenv alpha
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   workon alpha
   ```
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests==2.26.0 numpy==1.21.2
   ```

## Running the Scripts

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   workon alpha
   ```
2. Run the scripts:
   - To run `add.py`:
     ```bash
     python add.py
     ```
   - To run `apple.py`:
     ```bash
     python apple.py
     ```
   - To run `calculator.py`:
     ```bash
     python calculator.py
     ```

## Requirements

All the necessary packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them in a new virtual environment:

1. Create a new virtual environment:
   ```bash
   mkvirtualenv cf-python-base
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   workon cf-python-base
   ```
3. Install the packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

#### Exercise 1.2: Data Types in Python

**Files:**

- `basic_commands.py`: Demonstrates basic commands and operations in Python.
- `variables_and_types.py`: Shows variable assignments and data types.
- `type_conversion.py`: Demonstrates explicit and implicit type conversions.
- `reassignment_increment_decrement.py`: Shows reassignment, increment, and decrement operations.
- `variable_swapping.py`: Demonstrates variable swapping.
- `expressions_arithmetic.py`: Arithmetic operations and expressions.
- **Practice Task Files:**
  - `Practice_Task_1/compound_interest.py`
  - `Practice_Task_1/codepractice1.txt`
  - `Practice_Task_2/tuples_slicing.py`
  - `Practice_Task_3/lists_operations.py`
  - `Practice_Task_4/strings_slicing.py`
  - `Practice_Task_5/dictionaries_operations.py`
  - `Practice_Task_5/recipe_app.py`
- **Screenshots:** Screenshots documenting each step of the exercise.
- **Learning Journal:** Notes on what I've learned and my coding experience.

**Steps:**

1. Created scripts to demonstrate various data types and operations in Python.
2. Created a file containing values for compound interest calculation.
3. Performed various operations on tuples, lists, strings, and dictionaries.
4. Created data structures for a recipe app.

**Justification for Data Structures:**

- **Recipe Data Structure:** A dictionary was chosen to store recipe information because it allows for easy mapping of attribute names (keys) to their values (e.g., 'name', 'cooking_time', 'ingredients').
- **All Recipes Structure:** A list was chosen to store multiple recipes because it allows for easy sequential access and modification of recipes.

## Virtual Environment Setup

To set up the virtual environment and install required packages, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   mkvirtualenv cf-python-base


   ```
