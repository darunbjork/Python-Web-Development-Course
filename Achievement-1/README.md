## Virtual Environment Setup

To set up the virtual environment and install required packages, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   mkvirtualenv cf-python-base

Activate the virtual environment:
workon cf-python-base

Install required packages:
pip install requests numpy

Running the Scripts

Activate the virtual environment:
workon cf-python-base

Run the scripts:
To run add.py:
python add.py

To run apple.py:
python apple.py

To run calculator.py:
python calculator.py

Requirements

All the necessary packages are listed in the requirements.txt file. To install them in a new virtual environment:

Create a new virtual environment:
mkvirtualenv cf-python-base

Activate the virtual environment:
workon cf-python-base

Install the packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
