# Learning Journal

## Day 1: Setting Up the Environment

Today, I set up my development environment for the Python Web Development Course. This included installing Python 3.8.19 and Homebrew. I also created a new virtual environment named `alpha` and installed the `requests` and `numpy` packages.

## Day 2: Creating and Running Python Scripts

I created three Python scripts:

1. `add.py`: A simple script that adds two numbers.
2. `apple.py`: Demonstrates usage of the `requests` and `numpy` packages.
3. `calculator.py`: A basic calculator script with functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

I also learned how to activate and deactivate virtual environments and how to run Python scripts within these environments.

## Day 3: Documenting and Preparing for Deployment

I created the `README.md` and `LearningJournal.md` files to document my progress and prepare for deploying the project on GitHub. I also ensured that all necessary packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be easily installed in a new virtual environment.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Issue**: Encountered problems with importing `requests` and `numpy` in `apple.py` in VS Code.
  - **Solution**: Fixed the issue by opening a new terminal in VS Code and activating the virtual environment before running `pip install requests numpy`.
