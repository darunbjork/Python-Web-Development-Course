# Python-Web-Development-Course

This repository contains my projects and exercises from the Python Web Development Course.

## Projects and Exercises

### Achievement-1-Python

- **Exercise-1.1**: Basic Python scripting and virtual environment setup.
  - `add.py`: A simple addition script.
  - `apple.py`: Demonstrates usage of `requests` and `numpy` packages.
  - `calculator.py`: A basic calculator script with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division functions.

## Virtual Environment Setup

To set up the virtual environment and install required packages, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   mkvirtualenv alpha
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   workon alpha
   ```
3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install requests==2.26.0 numpy==1.21.2
   ```

## Running the Scripts

1. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   workon alpha
   ```
2. Run the scripts:
   - To run `add.py`:
     ```bash
     python add.py
     ```
   - To run `apple.py`:
     ```bash
     python apple.py
     ```
   - To run `calculator.py`:
     ```bash
     python calculator.py
     ```

## Requirements

All the necessary packages are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them in a new virtual environment:

1. Create a new virtual environment:
   ```bash
   mkvirtualenv cf-python-base
   ```
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   workon cf-python-base
   ```
3. Install the packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
